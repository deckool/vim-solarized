vim-solarized
=============

vim solarized with jade, markdown and stylus

simply copy all to `home/user/` path, rename it `.vim` maybe and there we go, we have a solarized vim bundled with [jade], [markdown] and [stylus] syntax.

It may be possible to change the main `etc/vim/vimrc` with `gvimrc` from this folder.

[markdown]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown
[stylus]: https://github.com/deckool/vim-stylus
