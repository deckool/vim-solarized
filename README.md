vim-solarized
=============

vim solarized with jade, markdown and stylus

simply copy all to 'home/user/' path, rename it '.vim' maybe and there we go, we have a solarized vim bundled with jade, markdown and stylus syntax.

It may be possible to change the main 'etc/vim/vimrc' with 'gvimrc' from this folder.
